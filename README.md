## Project Description

>"Design a modern day type specimen single-page website for a not so modern web safe font, make it “cool” again, and showcase that accessible type, color, and layout is not only *cool*, but a *best practice* for inclusive and responsible web design.
>
>Select a web safe font; show off its styles and weights: italic, normal, and bold; transform its cases: upper, lower, and even small-caps; change its size: 1em to 10em, smaller to larger; and even a swash such as a drop capital or an ornamental character such as an ampersand.
>
>Focus on typographic color: style, weight, size, and spacing, before reversed type, foreground and background color. Let the type talk first, then enhance by layering on accessible color to better communicate an aesthetic or emotion for color blind, low vision, and sighted users alike."
